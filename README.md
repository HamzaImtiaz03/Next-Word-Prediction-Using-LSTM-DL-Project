# Next Word Prediction with LSTM

## üìå Project Overview

This project presents a **Next Word Prediction** system built using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, developed with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The model is trained on the full text of *The Tragedy of Hamlet* by William Shakespeare to predict the next word given a sequence of input words.

The application features an interactive **Streamlit web interface** for real-time word prediction and is deployed in an environment managed by **Anaconda** to ensure reproducibility and clean dependency management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **LSTM-Based Model:** Employs a powerful sequence model using LSTM layers for accurate next-word prediction.
* **Text Tokenization:** Utilizes a Keras tokenizer to convert raw text into integer sequences suitable for neural network input.
* **Streamlit Interface:** Delivers an intuitive and responsive front-end for user interaction and live predictions.
* **Early Stopping:** Integrates early stopping during training to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
* **Pre-Trained Components:** Includes a pre-trained model (`next_word_lstm.h5`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.pickle`) for quick deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

* **Python:** Version 3.11
* **Anaconda:** For virtual environment and dependency management
* **Dependencies:** Specified in `requirements.txt`

## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
conda create -n next_word_prediction python=3.11
conda activate next_word_prediction
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
python -m streamlit --version
```

## üß† Usage Instructions

### Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> This will open the app in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the App:

1. Enter a phrase (e.g., `To be or not to`) in the input box.
2. Click on **"Predict Next Word"**.
3. The predicted word will appear below the input field.
